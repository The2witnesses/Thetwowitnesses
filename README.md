We live in an occult world. Fueled by an evil matrix. The Two witnesses are two supernatural heroes or divine sent intervention to fight this matrix.

According to the Christian Bible (which is a valid source of prophecy or future foretelling) they are the two lampstands and two olive trees that stand before God in heaven. The God that created the universe.

They are prophetic heavenly beings dressed in sack clothing that will be given superhuman divine powers and the divine task to prophecy for 1,260 days.

## What powers do they possess?

According to the Bible in the book of Revelation 11:3-6:

If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies. This is how anyone who wants to harm or trouble them dies. 

Such a scary feat.

But there's more:

They have power to shut up the heavens so that it will not rain during the time they are prophesying; and they have power to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want.

These powers are powers of chaos meaning they are chaotic beings.

## But are they bad news?

No they aren't.

They are sent from heaven and anything that cometh from heaven is kind, sweet and loving.

But they bring the chaos of God upon the evil matrix which corrupted the earth and ruined God's beautiful creation…earth & mankind.

## How did the matrix ruin the earth & mankind?

They are the perpetrators of all the evils that happen on the earth.

• Wars.
• Killings.
• And Diseases.

They corrupted human civilization with their different agendas. Which include the most infamous LGBTQ.

## Is the LGBTQ that bad?

They seem to have good intentions. But they carry a sinful motive.

They are corrupting schools with their teachings.

Little children are being taught about sexual relations between a man and a man and a woman with a woman. At such a young vital age.

And according to the Bible, homosexuality is a grievous sin. 

## How is homosexuality a grievous sin?

It is written in the books of Genesis, a city named Sodom and Gomorrah were punished heavily because of the sin of homosexuality. They were wiped off the face of the earth by fire and brimstone by God.

Also,

Passages preaching heavily about homosexuality can be found in the following:

### 1 Corinthians 6:9 NIV:
[9] Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men 

### 1 Timothy 1:10 NIV:
[10] for the sexually immoral, for those practicing homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers—and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine 

### Leviticus 18:22 NIV:
[22] “ ‘Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable.

### Romans 1:26 NIV:
[26] Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones.

### Romans 1:27 NIV:
[27] In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.

### Jude 1:7 NIV:
[7] In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. 

### Leviticus 20:13 NIV:
[13] “ ‘If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.

## What does it mean to be a witness?

In the law court, a witness is someone or something that have first viewer account of a crime.

The Two Witnesses have an account of everything wrong with the earth.

They preach a message of truth that will bring clarity & relief to everyone on what's really going on in the world.

## What's really going on in the world?

It is the end times.

And in the end times, strange things happen.

The Two Witnesses will let everyone know the root cause of the mayhem that will befall the world.

## What mayhem will befall the world?

The mayhem that will befall the world is prophesied in the book of Revelation.

## Who wrote the book of Revelation?

The Apostle John.

Who gave him the prophecies?

Jesus.

## Who is Jesus?

Jesus is the son of God who raptured people and took them away from this earth to prevent them from taking part of the chaos that awaits the world.

He died on a wooden cross for our sins.

So his father could look at him, remember his suffering and forgive us our sins and accept us into heaven.

He forgave his crucifiers even though they were wrongfully wrong and he was in the right.

So his father can say, if my son could agree to come to earth for this people's sake, live a poor life and suffer greatly on the cross and still forgive his wrongdoers, why not me.

But he did not stay dead.

He resurrected after 3 days and flew up to heaven the same way those who were raptured were taken to heaven via an ascension.

## How can I be part of the rapture?

The rapture has already taken place. But it's a secret the world failed to know.

It might happen again for the second or last time.

To be part of it, say this prayer with me:

Lord Jesus, I accept you as my personal Lord and Savior. Please come into my life. I agree to follow and do your good wills for my life. Thank you for dying on the cross for my sins and accepting me. Amen.

## When will the Two Witnesses arrive?

No one knows the exact time, but it's shortly after the rapture.

Meaning there is no time left.

What are their appearances?

No one knows their particular genders.

But according to the Bible they are known to wear sack clothing.

## What do we do now?

We can only sit, pray and watch. And that we take part in the coming second rapture. The mayhem awaiting the earth is too terrible to behold. Pray you are not part of it.

Now we await the coming of the two witnesses.
